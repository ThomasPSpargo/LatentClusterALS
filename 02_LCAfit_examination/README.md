## 02: Analysing Mplus fit

### Running most analyses

Scripts in this directory are all for extracting the results of a mplus LCA model, applying the fit to a secondary dataset, and analysis of the clinical characteristics across clusters identified.

These analyses are handled performed by running the `02_analyse_mplusfit.sh` script. This bash script overviews the use of each R script within this directory. The file-paths in this script must be updated for any re-runs.
